## The Problem

In the current gaming landscape, several challenges hinder the gaming experience:

- **Earning Limitations**: Traditional web2 games confine users' earning potential within rigid structures, limiting their ability to benefit from their skills.
- **Decentralization Focus**: Many decentralized games concentrate solely on P2P NFT P2E games, creating barriers to accessibility for a wider gaming audience.
- **User Experience Challenges**: Web3 games primarily prioritize Play-to-Earn (P2E) models, often resulting in subpar user experiences and subsequently, low user retention rates.

## Our Solution

Mystic emerges as an innovative solution to these challenges by introducing a novel approach to gaming:

- **Smart Contract Liquidity Pools**: Gamers can stake liquidity pools for online P2P tournaments, allowing up to 10 players to engage in competitive gaming scenarios.
- **Web2 Gamer Empowerment**: We provide fair earning opportunities for web2 gamers through various tournaments of web2 games, broadening the scope of potential earnings.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Our primary focus isn't solely on P2E models; instead, we're committed to optimizing gameplay experiences, ensuring our users engage in immersive and enjoyable gaming environments.

## Why Now?

Investing in web3 gaming has never been more opportune:

- **Huge Market Potential**: The gaming industry boasts a market cap of $217.06 billion, showcasing immense potential for growth and innovation.
- **Decentralized Gaming Growth**: Even in its early stages, decentralized games have reached a market cap of $5,498,548,288, indicating promising prospects for expansion.
- **Esports Evolution**: The current state of esports in web3 is significantly underdeveloped compared to web2, signifying untapped opportunities and growth potential.

## Tournament Mechanics

Here's how our tournament system works:

- Players stake an amount to participate in tournament-based games alongside real-time players.
- The winning prize is determined by the cumulative stakes and the number of participating players.
- Winners receive their share of the prize pool, distributed accordingly based on their performance.

## Like a Web3 Betting DApp, but Yourself

Mystic offers an experience akin to a web3 betting DApp, but with a unique twist: users bet on their own gaming prowess, competing in tournaments for rewarding experiences and tangible prizes.
